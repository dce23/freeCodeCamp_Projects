## Palindrome Checker
### In this project I built a palindrome checker which returns TRUE if the inputed string is a palindrome. Else the program will return FALSE
### A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward

## Roman Numeral Converter

## Caesars Cipher
### In this project I built a function that takes a encoded string rotate by 13 places as input and returns a decoded string

## Telephone Number Validator
